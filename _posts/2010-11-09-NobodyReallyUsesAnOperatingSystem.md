The title looks quite contriversial. But in my life, I have never seen anbody using an Operating System.

As wikipedia says,"An operating system (OS) is a software, consisting of programs and data, that runs on computers and manages the computer hardware and provides common services for efficient execution of various application programs".

People uses programs and the only mission of an operating system is to provide a platform and help those programs to run. So here comes the lt.col, sorry Kernel.
An operating system never does anything on its own. It`s always waiting for the programs to ask for certain resources, certain services, certain files or for programs to connect to the outside world and then steps in to make it easy for people to write programs.
